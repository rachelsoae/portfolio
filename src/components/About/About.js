            Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Rachel Soae Prather. I'm a Korean-American Software Engineer and Web Developer located outside Portland, Oregon.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mission is to Build Technology that Builds Community. In service of that mission, I work and volunteer with ethical organizations whose missions I strongly believe in. I am currently associated with Rita XYZ, Lesbians Who Tech & Allies, Out In Tech, Girls Who Code, and PDXWIT.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my downtime, I can be found eating kimchi, searching for the best honey at the farmer's market, and making music with friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would love to connect with you. <Link to='/contact' id='contact-link'>Let's create something meaningful together.</Link>
