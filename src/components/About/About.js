            Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Rachel Soae Prather. I'm a Korean-American Software Engineer and Web Developer located outside Portland, Oregon.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mission is to build technology that builds community. In service of that mission, I work and volunteer with ethical organizations I strongly believe in. I am currently associated with Rita XYZ, Girls Who Code, Out In Tech, and Lesbians Who Tech & Allies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was voted "Most Uplifting" by my graduating class at the Turing School of Software & Design, which I carry as one of my greatest accomplishments. I love collaboration and helping teams perform at their best!
          </p>
          <p>
            When I have downtime, I can be found eating kimchi, searching for the best honey at the farmer's market, and making music with friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would love to connect with you. <Link to='/contact' id='contact-link'>Let's create something meaningful together.</Link>
